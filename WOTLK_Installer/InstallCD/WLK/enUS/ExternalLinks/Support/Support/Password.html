        <p><font class="small_header_blue">Password Security:</font>        
        The following are some handy steps we recommend to ensure that your password is as safe as possible:
 
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your password does not contain words from ANY dictionary (forwards or backwards). 
            <li>Use letters, numbers, AND symbols. Simply adding a string of numbers at the end of the password may not be enough to guarantee security.
            <li>Do not use any keyboard sequences (e.g., qwerty).
            <li>Do not use your real name, account name, character names, or any variations thereof.
            <li>Avoid repeating small sequences of characters (e.g., abcabc).
        </ul>
