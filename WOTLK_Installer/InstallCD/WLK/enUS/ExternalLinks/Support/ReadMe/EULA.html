If any future changes to this License Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this License Agreement&#44; you may terminate this License Agreement in accordance with Section 7 herein. Your installation and use of any of Blizzard&#8217;s updates or modifications to the Game or your continued use of the Game following notice of changes to this Agreement will demonstrate your acceptance of any and all such changes.

</p><br/><p>
15. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law.
</p><br/><p>
A. Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute&#44; controversy or claim related to this License Agreement (&#34;Dispute&#34;)&#44; you and Blizzard agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one person to the other. Blizzard will send its notice to your billing address and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us. You will send your notice to Blizzard Entertainment&#44; Inc.&#44; P.O. Box 18979&#44; Irvine CA 92623&#44; attn&#58; Legal Department. 
</p><br/><p>
B. Binding Arbitration. If you and Blizzard are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations&#44; either you or Blizzard may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION&#44; YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&#34;AAA&#34;) and&#44; where appropriate&#44; the AAAs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&#34;AAA Consumer Rules&#34;)&#44; both of which are available that the AAA website www.adr.org. The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and&#44; where appropriate&#44; limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive&#44; Blizzard will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person&#44; through the submission of documents&#44; by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing&#44; but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law&#44; and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this License Agreement&#44; you and Blizzard may litigate in court to compel arbitration&#44; stay proceeding pending arbitration&#44; or to confirm&#44; modify&#44; vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
</p><br/><p>
C. Restrictions. You and Blizzard agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Blizzard and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law&#44; (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class&#45;action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
</p><br/><p>
D. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and Blizzard agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration&#58; (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect&#44; or concerning the validity of&#44; any of your or Blizzard&#8217;s intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to&#44; or arising from&#44; allegations of theft&#44; piracy&#44; invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.
</p><br/><p>
E. Location. If you are a resident of the United States&#44; any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States&#44; any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Los Angeles&#44; State of California&#44; United States of America. Any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court)&#44; or where no election to arbitrate has been made&#44; shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles&#44; State of California&#44; United States of America&#44; and you and Blizzard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
</p><br/><p>
F. Governing Law. Except as otherwise set forth herein&#44; this License Agreement shall be governed by&#44; and will be construed under&#44; the Laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Delaware&#44; without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. For our customers who purchased a license to the Game in&#44; and are a resident of&#44; Canada&#44; Australia&#44; Singapore&#44; or New Zealand&#44; other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above; provided&#44; however&#44; that such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. In such a case&#44; this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions hereof. If you purchased your license to the Game in New Zealand&#44; and are a resident of New Zealand&#44; The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (&#34;Act&#34;) may apply to the Game and/or the Service as supplied by Blizzard to you. If the Act applies&#44; then notwithstanding any other provision in this License Agreement&#44; you may have rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to&#44; or&#44; to the extent that they are inconsistent&#44; instead of&#44; the rights or remedies set out in this License Agreement. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside of the United States&#44; Canada&#44; Australia&#44; Singapore&#44; or New Zealand do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
</p><br/><p>
G. Severability. You and Blizzard agree that if any portion Section 15 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of 15(D)) that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 15(D) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Blizzard will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 15(D) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles&#44; State of California&#44; United States of America&#44; and you and Blizzard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
</p><br/><p>
16. Miscellaneous. This License Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements&#44; provided&#44; however&#44; that this Agreement shall coexist with&#44; and shall not supersede&#44; the Terms of Use. To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement conflict with the provisions of the Terms of Use&#44; the conflicting provisions in the Terms of Use shall govern. The provisions of Sections 4(A)&#44; 6&#44; 11&#45;13&#44; 15 and 16 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable&#44; that provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
</p><br/><p>
I hereby acknowledge that I have read and understand the foregoing License Agreement and agree that by clicking &#34;Accept&#34; or installing the Game Client I am acknowledging my agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
