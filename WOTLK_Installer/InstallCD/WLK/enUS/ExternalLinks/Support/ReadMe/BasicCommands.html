        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Basic options:&nbsp;</font>
        Hit Esc to bring up the main menu, where you can adjust video, audio, and game settings as well as re-map your key bindings. 
        <blockquote>
        <font class="small_header" style="color:#559fdd">Tip:&nbsp;</font>
        For a complete list of keys, hit Esc, then select "Key Bindings". Scroll down to see all the possible keys. 
        </blockquote></p>
        
		<a id="Movement" name="Movement"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Movement:&nbsp;</font>
        Use the A,W,D,S keys to move around the world. Alternatively, hold down both mouse buttons to walk forward; moving the mouse at this point turns your character.  There is also a "Click to move" option in the "Interface Options" menu which will allow you to move your character by right-clicking the area of the ground you wish to move to.
        </p>
      
		<a id="Camera" name="Camera"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Camera:&nbsp;</font>
        Hold down the left mouse button to look around the world. Hold down the right mouse button to turn your character using the mouse. You can zoom the camera in and out with either the mouse wheel or the Home and End keys.
        </p>
        
		<a id="Interacting" name="Interacting"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Interacting:&nbsp;</font>
        Left-click selects objects and NPCs in the game, while right-click attacks a monster, activates an object, or talks to an NPC. The mouse cursor is context-sensitive. If you mouse over an object that you can interact with, an icon will appear on your mouse cursor indicating the type of action that will occur if you right-click (sword = attack, cog = manipulate, speech balloon = talk, etc.). 
        </p>
        
		<a id="Attacking" name="Attacking"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Attacking:&nbsp;</font>
        To attack a creature, move within range (indicated by the appearance of the attack cursor when you mouse over the creature; a grayed-out cursor means you are out of range) and right-click the creature. You will enter attack mode. Move your character next to the creature, and you will automatically begin to attack. Instead of right-clicking a creature, you may also select the "Attack" icon from the Action Bar. 
        </p>
       
		<a id="Action" name="Action"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Action Bar:&nbsp;</font>
        The Action Bar at the bottom of the screen can be used to hotkey your spells, special abilities, or frequently used items, such as food and water (which give back health and mana, respectively). You can activate these either by left-clicking on them or by typing the number corresponding to the slot of the spell or ability you wish to use. Mousing over the icons will show you a tooltip containing the name of the spell or ability. You can also consult your spell or ability books (for casters, the "Spellbook & Abilities" button on the Action Bar) to get a full description of each ability or spell your character may have. You can rearrange your Action Bar by dragging the icons around. You can also add new spells or abilities to this bar as you receive them by dragging them from your spell or ability book. You can also place inventory items, such as health potions, in the bar for easy activation. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <font class="small_header" style="color:#559fdd">Tip:&nbsp;</font>
        Hold down Shift and use the mouse wheel to quickly flip between Action Bars. You can also use the up and down arrow keys instead of the mouse wheel. 
        </blockquote>        
        </p>
       
		<a id="Interaction" name="Interaction"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Grouping, trading, and other character interaction:&nbsp;</font>
        To invite someone into a group, left-click that player and then right-click on the player's portrait along the top of the screen to bring up a menu of possible interactions. One of these options is to "Invite" (into your group). There are several other available interactions with characters, including inspecting them, or challenging them to duels.

        <font class="small_header_blue">Character information:&nbsp;</font>
        Click on the button in the Interface Panel (which is to the right of the Action Bar) that contains your character's portrait. This will bring up your Character Info panel, which includes your Reputation and Skills panels.

		<a id="Leveling" name="Leveling"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Leveling:&nbsp;</font>
        Once you reach level 10, you will begin gaining talent points as you level up, which you can immediately apply to your character by opening up the Talent Info page by clicking on the Talents button in the Interface Panel. The Talents page shows all the new talents you can purchase. 
        </p> 
      
		<a id="Spells" name="Spells"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Gaining new spells & abilities:&nbsp;</font>
        New abilities and skills are not gained automatically. You must visit a trainer specific to your class to purchase them. There are other ways to gain spells and abilities, such as completing class-specific quests.

		<a id="Looting" name="Looting"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Looting:&nbsp;</font>

        <p class="normal">
        <font class="small_header_blue">Getting additional bags:&nbsp;</font>
        You can put an additional bag in each empty bag space in the lower right part of your screen (next to the backpack). Use your additional bags the same way you do your backpack. 
        </p>
      
		<a id="Slash" name="Slash"></a>
        <p class="normal">
        <span class="small_header_blue">Slash commands:&nbsp;</span>
        The following are some of the common slash commands in the game, which allow you to do certain things just by typing them into the chat prompt. Hit Enter to bring up the chat prompt.
