        <p class="normal">Thank you for purchasing World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King! The ships are ready to embark, and many new, exciting lands, adventures, and challenges await you in Northrend. In addition, we're proud to introduce the first Hero Class to veteran players: the Death Knight! </p> 

	<p class="normal">Wrath of the Lich King represents an enormous focus of time and resources on giving players even more to explore and experience in World of Warcraft. This expansion would not have been possible without the huge support of the community. We sincerely thank you for that support and for the patience you show while we work on World of Warcraft, and we hope you enjoy all of the new content.</p>
        
        <p class="normal">See you in the game!</p>
