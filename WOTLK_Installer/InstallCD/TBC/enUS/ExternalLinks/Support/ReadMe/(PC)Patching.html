			Patching Information (PC)
		</a>		
        <p>Updates to the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King take the form of automatically-delivered patches. When an update is made available, it will be delivered to your computer when you next launch World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King and connect to a server. It can take between seconds and hours to download a patch, depending on the size of the patch. Patches come with patch text notes detailing the changes made for that version.
 
        <p>Patching is normally automatic; you do not need to do anything special to receive a patch. Patching is also not optional; you must have the most current version in order to play on the World of Warcraft servers. If you have problems with the patching process, please <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">contact Technical Support</a>.
