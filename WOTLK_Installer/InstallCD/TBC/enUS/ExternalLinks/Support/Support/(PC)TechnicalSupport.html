			Contacting Technical Support (PC)
		</a>		
        <p>There are a variety of resources available to you if you are having problems with your game. Remember, while Game Support exists to provide assistance with the operation of the game and understanding of game functions, Technical Support is intended to assist with matters of program failure. Technical Support cannot assist with gameplay-related questions.</p>
