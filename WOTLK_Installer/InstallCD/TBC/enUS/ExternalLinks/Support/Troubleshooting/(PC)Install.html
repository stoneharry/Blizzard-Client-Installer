        <p>If you encounter any errors while installing World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, please check your DVD  to verify that it is  clean and scratch-free. Even the smallest scratch or bit of dirt can prevent your DVD-ROM  drive from reading the disk. If your disk is clean and scratch-free, please try the steps below to see if they resolve your error.</p>
      
        <p><span class="small_header_blue">1. Shut down any background or antivirus programs:</span> Antivirus applications can interfere with installers on some computers.

	<p><span class="small_header_blue">3. Try the disk in a new drive:</span> If you have another DVD-ROM drive in your computer, try inserting the disk into that drive to see if you can successfully install the game from it.
