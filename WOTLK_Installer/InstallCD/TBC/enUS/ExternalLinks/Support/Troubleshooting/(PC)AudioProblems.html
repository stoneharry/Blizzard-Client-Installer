        <p class="normal">Here are some of the most commonly experienced sound issues. If you are experiencing a problem that is not listed below, or the steps listed do not resolve the problem, please   
        <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">contact Technical Support</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">1. Some sounds are playing much louder than others:</font> This is often the result of inappropriate audio settings. Delete the Config.wtf file. This file can be found in the World of Warcraft WTF folder (C:/../World of Warcraft/WTF/Config.wtf).</p>  

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">2. Sound starts to decay until no sound can be heard:</font> Try reinstalling 
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new">DirectX</a> and reinstalling the latest drivers for your sound card. It is possible that some program has modified the DirectSound or driver settings. </p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">3. Cannot hear any sound at all:&nbsp;</font> Check the file "SESound.log" for errors initializing. This log can be found in the World of Warcraft root directory. If errors exist, send the log and a description of the problem to Technical Support.

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">4. Popping or cracking sounds while playing the game:&nbsp;</font>Uninstall any programs that may have placed audio codecs on your system (e.g., video/audio players). Disable other audio software during gameplay. MP3 players, for example, drain system resources used by World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, and often bring about sound corruption. </p>
        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">5. Audigy 2 crashes:</font> If you are using an Audigy 2, and you are experiencing game crashes or system reboots, you may need to reconfigure the audio output. Look in your \SBAudigy2\Program\WDM\COMMON\ directory for a file called "CtPanel.exe". With this tool you will be able to modify your device settings. Under "Speaker Settings", change CMSS 3D Selection to "Off". </p>
