        <p>You may find graphic, sound, or interface anomalies while playing the game. Examples might include control issues while interacting with the user interface, display problems with your character, player communication problems, or even issues with how skills are working.</p>

        <p><font class="small_header_blue">1. Custom user interfaces:&nbsp;</font>In order to offer the greatest amount of flexibility and functionality for the player, the user interface (UI) in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King has been designed so that it may be customized. However, UI customization is not a supported feature of the game. If you are having any technical issues related to the game, please remove all custom UI files from your installation before contacting Technical Support.

        <p>Custom content for the user interface is stored in the Interface folder in the root World of Warcraft directory. Delete any Interface folder you see there, along with any files inside. The game will display the default interface the next time you start. Make sure you do not delete any other Interface files or folders from the game folder. </p>
